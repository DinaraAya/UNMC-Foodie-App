         <p><b>Q: What is the UNMC FoodHub app?</b><br/>
         A: UNMC FoodHub is a mobile application designed specifically for our university&#39;s cafeteria. It allows students and staff to pre-order meals and schedule pickups, helping them avoid long wait times and crowded spaces during peak hours.</p>

         <p><b>Q: How does the app work?</b><br/>
         A: Simply browse the cafeteria menu through the app, select your meal, choose a pickup time, and place your order. You&#39;ll receive a notification when your meal is ready for collection. You can also view real-time updates on how crowded the cafeteria is before heading there.</p>

         <p><b>Q: Can I cancel or modify my order after placing it?</b><br/>
         A: Yes, you can modify or cancel your order within a specific time window. However, once the meal preparation has started, cancellations or changes may not be possible.</p>

         <p><b>Q: How do I pay for my meal?</b><br/>
         A: The app accepts secure payments through various methods such as credit/debit cards, e-wallets, or cash upon pickup. You can add your preferred payment method during registration.</p>

         <p><b>Q: What if I miss my pickup time?</b><br/>
         A: If you miss your scheduled pickup time, your order will be held for a limited period. However, food quality may be affected, and after a certain period, the order may be canceled with no refund depending on the cafeteria&#39;s policy.</p>
